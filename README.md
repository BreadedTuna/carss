## A note about forks

Some people have been forking this repo in order to make their own instance of the website, to work around school firewalls. While I have no issue with people forking this code for any reason, these forks will fail to work online because my servers only have my jchabin.github.io domain whitelisted, and I cannot remove this whitelist without risking unauthorized and outdated versions of my game being distributed onto sketchy, ad-filled websites.
